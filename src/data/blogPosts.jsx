    <p>
      At Apple Home, we believe that the best technology doesn't get in the way — it helps you connect more deeply with the world around you.

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Heart of Design</h3>
    <p>
      Every detail matters. From the curvature of a button to the weight of a gesture, our goal is to make your experience seamless and intuitive.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Human-Centered Innovation</h3>
    <p>
      We start with people — not pixels. Whether it's how a product feels in your hand or how it fits into your daily life, everything is designed with purpose.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Technology should feel invisible. When it works like you think and moves like you feel, it becomes part of your life — not a distraction from it.

    <p>
      The most powerful experiences are often the simplest. Here’s how we build products that empower without overwhelming.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Less Is More</h3>
    <p>
      Simplicity isn’t about removing features — it's about making the right ones accessible. That’s the core of our design philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Every Detail Has a Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      There’s no wasted space. No unnecessary animations. No extra clicks. Just what you need, when you need it.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Powerful Under the Hood</h3>
    <p>
      What looks simple on the outside can be incredibly advanced underneath. We spend years perfecting the details so you don’t have to think about them.

      Our vision is a future where tech blends into daily life, enhancing comfort, safety, and connection — quietly and naturally.

      Intelligence isn’t just about speed — it’s about understanding context. Our devices learn from how you use them, getting better at helping you every day.
